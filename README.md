# Class Project
This project aims for the practical application of the fundamentals of the C# programming language.

## Module 01
### Variables
A variable in C# is a memory space reserved for storing data. Variables are used to store information that can be manipulated and utilized in a program. In C#, variables need to be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.
Some examples of variables in C#:

#### String
``` csharp
string dogName = "Panda";
Console.WriteLine("Dog name: " + dogName);
```

#### Integer (int)
``` csharp
int dogAge = 5;
Console.WriteLine("Age: " + dogAge);
```

#### Double
``` csharp
double dogWeight = 8.2;
Console.WriteLine("Weight: " + dogWeight);
```

#### Floating-point (float)
``` csharp
float dogHeight = 0.25f;
Console.WriteLine("Dog height: " + dogHeight + " meters");
```

#### Boolean (bool)
``` csharp
bool isVaccinated = true;
Console.WriteLine("Is vaccinated? " + isVaccinated);
```

#### Character (char)
``` csharp
char letter = 'P';
Console.WriteLine("Letter: " + letter);
```

#### Date (DateTime)
``` csharp
DateTime dogBirthDate = new DateTime(2017, 11, 9);
Console.WriteLine("BirthDate: " + dogBirthDate.ToShortDateString());
```

### Constants
Constants are fields and locations whose values are fixed and cannot be changed once they have been defined. 
These values can be strings, numbers, boolean values or a null reference.
``` csharp
const string description = "CSharp Course";
Console.WriteLine("Const string: " + description);
```
### Arithmetic Operators
The mathematical operations are executed with special symbols, arithmetic operators, on variables and values that allow it to perform common operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The main arithmetic operators in C# are:

#### Addition (+)
``` csharp
int result = 1 + 2;
```

#### Subtraction (-)
``` csharp
int result = 3 - 4;
```

#### Multiplication (*)
``` csharp
int result = 5 * 6;
```

#### Division (/)
``` csharp
int result = 7 / 2;
```

### Relational Operators
### Logical Operators
### Ternary Operators
